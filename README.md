# **Research Data Management & Analytics Platform**

A fully integrated research data management and analytics environment was designed and deployed within the **Research & Innovation Department**.  
The platform was built using **containerized services** orchestrated with **Docker**, ensuring portability, scalability, and reproducibility across environments.

## **Core Components**

- **postgres** ‚Äì Created a database to centralize the data generated in the labs.
- 
- **eLabFTW** ‚Äì Configured as the department‚Äôs **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)**  
  - Customized for research workflows and metadata standards  
  - Enabled timestamped data certification for reproducibility and compliance  

- **Apache Airflow** ‚Äì Deployed for **ETL automation** and data orchestration
  - Scheduled ingestion, transformation, and synchronization of datasets  
  - Modular pipelines to support multiple research projects in parallel  

- **Apache Superset** ‚Äì Integrated for **interactive dashboards and advanced analytics**  
  - Connected to operational and analytical databases for real-time reporting  
  - Designed visualizations to monitor research activity, trends, and KPIs

## **Security & Authentication**

- **Keycloak** implemented as the **central identity provider**  
  - Used **OpenID Connect** and **SAML** for single sign-on (SSO) across all services  
  - Managed **role-based access control (RBAC)** to enforce data governance policies  

- **NGINX Reverse Proxy** with **SSL/TLS encryption**  
  - Domain-based routing for each service  
  - Enforced secure access via HTTPS for all endpoints  

---

## **Infrastructure**

- **Cloud Hosting:** Azure Virtual Machines with optimized configurations for concurrent workloads  
- **Persistent Storage:** Docker volumes for long-term data retention  
- **Automated Backups:** Snapshot policies for disaster recovery readiness  
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimized container resources and database indexing for faster queries  

---

## **Impact**

This implementation:  

- Consolidated multiple research tools into a **single, cohesive platform**  
- Reduced administrative overhead through automation and SSO  
- Improved collaboration and data transparency across research teams  
- Established a **standardized data lifecycle** from capture to visualization  
- Created a foundation for future **machine learning and predictive analytics** initiatives
